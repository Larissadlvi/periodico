  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm">
<p>World number one men's tennis player Novak Djokovic has had his visa to enter Australia dramatically revoked on his arrival in Melbourne, amid a huge backlash over a vaccine exemption.

  Djokovic was held in the airport for several hours before border officials announced he had not met entry rules.
  
  He was then taken to a government detention hotel. A court will decide on his deportation on Monday.
  
  The row is around an exemption he had to play in the Australian Open.
  
  Tournament organisers said the Serbian player, who has said he is opposed to vaccination, had been granted medical exemption by two independent medical panels organised by Tennis Australia, the body that runs the event, and Victoria state.
  
  The decision infuriated many in a country that has seen a surge in Covid-19 cases, and where over 90% of those over 16 are fully vaccinated. People have also had to endure some of the world's strictest restrictions and some still cannot travel between states or internationally.
  
  On Wednesday, border officials said the 34-year-old had "failed to provide appropriate evidence" for entry after arriving from Dubai. He is now being held at a hotel in the Melbourne suburb of Carlton which is used for immigration detention.
  
  "Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia," the Australian Border Force (ABF) said in a statement.
  
  Djokovic's team challenged ABF's decision, and a hearing at the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia has been scheduled for Monday.

<p>Max Verstappen clinched his first Formula One World Championship after beating Lewis Hamilton in a controversial season finale at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday.

  This season had been heralded as one of the greatest in the sport's history and the title race went down to one of the most "insane" final laps possible.
  Hamilton had all but won his record-breaking eighth world title until Williams Racing driver Nicholas Latifi crashed into the barriers with four laps remaining, resulting in the safety car being called out.
  It meant the race restarted on the final lap, with Verstappen allowed to start almost side-by-side Hamilton, despite the Brit having established a healthy lead.
  The Dutchman, on new tires, had the pace to overtake his rival and win one of the most dramatic F1 races ever.
  "It's insane. I don't know what to say. I'm so pleased for the team and for all these guys. I love working with them so much," an emotional and slightly stunned Verstappen, 24, said after the race.
  "Finally, today, I had a bit of luck. My team know I love them and I want to do this with them for the next 10 or 15 years!"
  The victory means Verstappen prevented Hamilton from surpassing the record he still shares with racing legend Michael Schumacher.
  Mercedes confirmed it had lodged two protests relating to the end of the race, but both were rejected by officials later on Sunday.
  The team then lodged an intention to appeal against the decision relating to restarting the race for the last lap.

<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:olivedrab">SPECIAL: “You want to make everything worth it”– Daniel Ricciardo tells how he paid McLaren back after sluggish 2021 start</h1>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm">
<p>Daniel Ricciardo was signed by McLaren with major hopes. Team principal Andreas Seidl wanted the Australian to have an immediate impact with all the experience he had.

  However, to everyone’s plight, Ricciardo had a sluggish start with the Woking-based team. Though, the 32-year-old driver improved in his performances later into the season.
  
  “We do get paid well, there’s no mistake,” Ricciardo explained in an exclusive interview with RacingNews365.com. “And when you don’t perform or deliver, of course, part of you feels like, ‘F***’.
  
  “You want to make everything worth it, and you want the team to feel like every cent they’ve spent, they’re getting in return. So I think that’s a simple way to put it but yeah, there is an element of that, there is, for sure. So luckily, Monza I think paid everyone back.”
  Recalling that dark patch, Ricciardo told that he always had a disappointing feeling. But according to him, he managed to pay his team back by giving an amazing performance in Italy.

“I don’t want to say that I don’t need to do it again,” the 32-year-old added. “But it definitely made all the bad days of this year worth it. Do I wish that I had better days in the first six months? Of course.”

“But I think it also proved to the team that not only I still have what it takes to win races, but I can pull myself out of a hole, and I think it gives them faith as well that if I have a few more difficult races again, they’re going to be a little less stressed about it.”

“I know that [they can think], ‘Okay, he has what it takes to deliver. So let’s just be patient.’ And I think they have been. [With team boss] Andreas [Seidl], it’s hard to face anyone in the team that expects more from you.”
