            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Baking Impossible is a competition where teams of bakers and engineers — put together by judge and preeminent “bakineer” Andrew Smyth — make mostly-edible creations that can withstand a particular week’s stress test. The winning team of each “mission” gets a leg up on the next one, and the losing team goes home. The overall winning team gets $100,000.

                In the first “mission”, the teams, who are just being introduced to each other, have 9 hours to build a boat. There are a few requirements, including a “dessert” element that will be judged on the usual food show taste/texture standards. There will also be sails and a remote-controlled rudder.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-0" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Biohackers</h5>
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The characters of Biohackers are faced with such mystery in situations that are larger than anything they could’ve imagined, that they play God in their own journey of synthetic science. Big stuff.

                This six-part German Netflix series is everything but what you would expect of a European sci-fi thriller. Created by Christian Ditter (of How to Be Single and Love, Rosie), instead of moving from planet to planet in an unbelievable this-will-never-happen flurry, Biohackers is a fast-paced thriller that touches on lust and young relationships, as well as heartbreak and loss, and it’s the better for it. 
                
                The show keeps the topic of modern science at its core, in a way attractive enough to keep even those disinterested with topics of biology engaged. By casting talented, young and diverse actors in the lead roles, Ditter creates a symphony of humour, gripping drama and romance.
                
                Scene one of the first episode opens with a young seem-to-be couple on a train. Suddenly, passengers start to suffer respiratory problems, the numbers increasing more quickly as time goes on. A doctor is called for and a young medical student, Mia (Luna Wedler), offers her help. She tries to defibrillate the unconscious passengers, but her best efforts are not enough.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-0" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Vikings</h5>
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Following the journey of Ragnar Lothbrok, Vikings is a fascinating and often violent look into the lives of the first Norsemen in history.  Full of dramatic tension and leaning (mostly) toward historical accuracy, Vikings does a great job blending fact and fiction to produce a methodically paced, interesting journey through the lives of the infamous warriors of the North. Along with an endearing group of characters by Ragnar’s side and fuelled by an endearing storyline, Vikings’ first season is a solid foundation for a show that promises to build on the great work done here.

                The story starts with Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) and follows his journey across the sea West where he lands in Britain and begins raiding monasteries. From here, the plot line evolves to include a wrestle for power back in the Viking homeland, someone close to Ragnar conspiring in the shadows against him and a bitter rivalry brewing between Lothbrok and Earl Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne). This mixture of political intrigue, drama and violence woven through the story and various subplots helps Vikings stand out from other historical dramas that focus on a much more static and clichéd storyline.
                
                As well as a compelling story, Vikings includes a well fleshed out cast of characters, each with their own motivations and unique personas. Ragnar’s wife Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick) is as powerful and motivated as her husband, Rollo (Clive Staden) is as physically imposing as he is cunning and a whole slew of characters alongside these stand out in their own way. Ragnar (Travis Fimmel) is still the focal point for much of this season though and his cool exterior juxtaposes a fierce, internal determination that drives the narrative forward. Opposite Ragnar and his loyal crew, Earl Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne) acts as a constant thorn in Ragnar’s ambitions and their rivalry sparks much of the controversy and issues that stem through the first 9 episodes of the series.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-0" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">La Casa de Papel</h5>
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">If you love heist movies, then Netflix has a massive treat for you. ‘Money Heist’ is its Spanish-language original that follows an elaborate heist masterminded by a man called the Professor. Apart from enjoying massive popularity in Spain, the show has also become a favourite with the international audience, owing to the exposure provided by Netflix. The series is an adventurous ride packed with many edge-of-the-seat moments. If you haven’t yet seen it, head over to Netflix. Also, this article contains the discussion of just the first season, so you needn’t worry for the spoilers if you haven’t yet watched beyond it. 
            The show begins with a woman, who identifies herself as Tokyo, running from the cops. Just as she is about to walk into their trap, she crosses paths with the Professor who offers her another job. He has come up with a plan that would get them more money than anyone has even landed from a heist. He has also recruited a bunch of other people, all specialists in their fields. For five months, they work on perfecting the plan. But when it comes to actually execute it, it doesn’t take much time for things to go south, especially with the involvement of Inspector Raquel Murillo.

            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Raymond Holt becomes the captain of the NYPD's fictional 99th precinct and almost immediately clashes with Jake Peralta as he is childish but a great detective, who's as immature as he is skilled at solving crimes. In other events, the precinct's annual Halloween heist bet is established, Charles Boyle is shot in the butt while protecting partner Detective Rosa Diaz from a criminal with a grudge against Holt, the squad gets a glimpse into Holt's home life at a party thrown by him and his husband Kevin, Charles begins a relationship with a woman, Vivian, that ends when their engagement is called off and Jake develops feelings for his partner, fellow detective Amy Santiago after winning a bet against her, that sees them go on a fake date and have a great time. Amy begins dating Teddy, a cop whom she knew from earlier, much to Jake's jealousy. The season ends with Jake going undercover..</p>
