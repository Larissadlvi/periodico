            <p>It’s officially after After Hours. The Weeknd announced that his new album, Dawn FM, will be released on
                Friday, January 7. The musician had been teasing the new project for months, ever since declaring “the dawn
                is coming” at this past May’s Billboard Music Awards and later releasing the single “Take My Breath” in
                August. Now the pop star, a.k.a. Abel Tesfaye, has followed up with a minute-long trailer for Dawn FM, a
                radio-inspired album that seems to keep with the cinematic inspirations for his 2020 blockbuster, After
                Hours. The clip shows the Weeknd crashing a car, being kidnapped by mysterious cloaked figures, and getting
                taken somewhere eerie. We also get a glimpse of an aged Weeknd and of a new all-black leather suit, which we
                can only hope is this era’s uniform. “You are now listening to 103.5 Dawn FM,” says a voice at the end of
                the video. “You’ve been in the dark for way too long. It’s time to walk into the light and accept your fate
                with open arms.”
    
                The Weeknd previously alluded to the album’s upcoming release on January 1, posting a text conversation with
                his creative director, La Mar Taylor, to social media. “Everything feels chaotic again,” he wrote. “Music
                can heal and that feels more important than another album rollout. Let’s just drop the whole thing and enjoy
                it with the people … XO.”
    
                Per the trailer, the album’s collaborators include the Weeknd’s neighbor Jim Carrey; Quincy Jones; Tyler,
                the Creator; Lil Wayne; and After Hours producer Oneohtrix Point Never. The Weeknd spent much of 2021
                collaborating with other musicians, featuring on songs by Ariana Grande, Doja Cat, Swedish House Mafia,
                Rosalía, Post Malone, FKA Twigs, and Aaliyah. As for his solo accomplishments in 2021? Just headlining the
                Super Bowl, creating a TV series, and logging the longest-charting song ever. Who needs the Grammys anyway?

            <h5 class="mt-0" style="color: olivedrab;">Why Does ‘Emily in Paris’ Make People So Mad?</h5>
            <p>“Emily in Paris” has a way of driving viewers crazy.
    
                There were groans when the Netflix series’ first season was nominated for best comedy at the Golden Globes
                and at the Emmys. And it occasioned a widely-circulated New Yorker piece that described it as part of a
                rising trend of “ambient TV,” describing it as “an artifact of contemporary dystopia.”
                Television that exists to be viewed ambiently rather than deeply obsessed over is something that’s been with
                us throughout the history of the medium; indeed, it’s only relatively recently that televised dramas started
                being treated as high art. And so it is that in its second season, “Emily in Paris” serves up more of the
                same, and more of something TV can do well: Charming, watchable, low-friction entertainment in a setting
                that’s fun to look at. It’s not the best of anything. But it’s good TV.
    
                As played by Lily Collins, Emily is something of a cipher: She wants to be in Paris because she’s looking
                for love and new experiences, but she seems to exercise little will of her own, stumbling into and out of
                situations. Her triumphs at work, at a luxury-goods marketing firm, are, viewed charitably, serendipitous —
                viewed more realistically, they’re often entirely accidental. When she errs, no one stays angry with her for
                long. And when she scores a win, it’s quickly dispensed with as her coworkers move on to the next thing.
    
                All of which adds up to a show that isn’t terribly cerebral or demanding, coasting on the charm of its
                setting and the age-old culture-clash storyline. (Indeed, in depicting an American whose sunny self-belief
                erodes the defenses of stuffy Europeans, “Emily in Paris” can play at times like a distaff “Ted Lasso.”) But
                being a good hang counts for something. And the flaws of “Emily in Paris” — its refusal to engage with the
                concept of actions having consequences, for instance — can be seen as the result of its endless pursuit of
                showing us the next charming setting, the next delirious misunderstanding. It’s television that is truly
                episodic, staging situations and resolving them with close to as little long-term change made as on an
                episode of “The Simpsons.”
    
    
                Which is not to say that any old slop can be excused as long as it entertains someone. But “Emily in Paris”
                features shrewd acting by Collins, holding her features somewhat blankly as a comment on the social-media
                age that I’d argue the show knows it is making. If Emily’s life in pursuit of Instagram likes is
                “dystopian,” the show is aware of this; the randomness of her successes at work seems a comment on the
                capriciousness of life online.
    
                Similarly, this series has something to say about self-absorption: Emily’s failure to learn French or
                immerse herself in French culture, a bugbear of the show’s haters, is treated critically in this new season.
                Her American-ness, her insistence on her own exceptional nature, often helps Emily out, but it also is
                shown, at times, as an inherent limitation she must work to overcome. She is forced to confront, in
                sitcom-appropriate ways, herself, all against a bubbly backdrop that lightens the mood.
    
                That ebullient setting can too easily be read as all that’s going on in the picture. And maybe the fact that
                “Emily in Paris” can be interpreted in such wildly differing ways — as among TV’s very best, as harbinger of
                the end times, or as a fine show that manages to raise spirits and be about something — suggests that
                there’s some art in the formula after all.</p>
